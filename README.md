# 📅 Day 54 – GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🧮 Problem: Count the Number of Pairs with Given Sum in a Sorted Array
### 🧠 Difficulty: Medium
### 📌 Tag: #Day54 #gfg160 #geekstreak2025
### 🚀 Status: Successfully Solved ✅

## 📋 Problem Statement:
Given a sorted array and a target sum, your task is to count the number of unique pairs whose sum equals the target.
You must consider frequency of elements and handle duplicates with precision.

## 🔍 Optimized Strategy: Two-Pointer with Frequency Handling
### 💡 Key Insight:
- Since the array is sorted, initialize two pointers from both ends.

- If the sum of elements equals the target:

- Check if both elements are the same. Use the nC2 formula to count combinations.

- Else, count the frequency of both left and right elements and multiply.

- Adjust pointers smartly and avoid duplicates.
